# Scala ListBuffer to Immutable List Conversion

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when converting a Scala `ListBuffer` (mutable) to a `List` (immutable).  The primary issue lies in not being explicit about the conversion method, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or subtle errors, especially in concurrent environments.  The solution offers best practices and alternative methods to ensure a correct and reliable transformation.

## Problem

While simply calling `toList` often seems to work, relying on this alone can be problematic. The provided example shows that using the standard `toList` method successfully converts the list in simple cases but suggests exploring more explicit alternatives for robust code.
